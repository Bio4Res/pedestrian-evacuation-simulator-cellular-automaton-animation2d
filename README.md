# pedestrian-evacuation-simulator-cellular-automaton-animation2d
Animates in 2D a trace of an evacuation as simulated by a cellular automaton.

## Requirements

This project has the following dependencies:

* [pedestrian-evacuation-simulator-environment](https://github.com/Bio4Res/pedestrian-evacuation-simulator-environment): library for representing and manipulating environments from which evacuation is to be performed
* [pedestrian-evacuation-simulator-cellular-automaton-trace](https://github.com/Bio4Res/pedestrian-evacuation-simulator-cellular-automaton-trace): library for representing and manipulating 
  traces of an evacuation as simulated by a cellular automaton

Maven users: these dependencies are already included in the <code>pom.xml</code> file
